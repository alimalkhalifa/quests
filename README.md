My quest scripts to use with my custom db + source

(This readme file will serve as the global readme file for the project: server code, quest scripts, database work)

This quest repository is focused on classic - Kunark - Velious.

Right now (december 2017), the bulk of the quest & content work is being done on vanilla EverQuest.

Current highlights include, but are not limited to:
===================================================

- Every single class/race/deity newbie quests (and their associated recipes) have been fixed/implemented wherever needed.

- Restored a ton of fluff/classically accurate dialogues wherever applicable. This is an ongoing process.

- Fully working boat system (mix of perl & a bit of C++ backend regarding static & empty zones). Firiona Vie's Maiden Voyage is useable and *working* (due to a small C++ 'hack')

Vanilla boat routes: Freeport -> OOT -> Butcherblock -> Freeport, Erudin (complete with the Erudin shuttles) -> Erud's Crossing -> Qeynos -> Erud's Crossing -> Erudin.

- A ton of faction work, which, while not 110% classically accurate, will be better than stock database values. This is an ongoing process.

- A lot of items with newer graphics have been reverted to their classic counterparts. This is an ongoing process.

- A lot of various NPCs features (faces, textures...) that were lost due to Luclin+ models are restored to their classic counterparts, which drastically reduces the "samey" look of NPCs across the world. This is an ongoing process.

- Classic Cazic-Thule (not the high level version)

- Classic Paw (the gnoll version)

- Day/night cycle in Kithicor Forest. Watch out for those pesky undeads!
- Day/night cycle in East Karana - boy, those undead gnolls DO smell bad!
- Day/night cycle in Lake Rathetear - undead gnolls spawn in the camp @ South Karana's zone line. Beware!
- Generally speaking: day/night cycles enabled wherever needed. This is an ongoing process!

- Fixed tons of bad spawns/bad path grids/statically immobile NPCs/missing spawns etc etc. This is an ongoing process.
